const pythonLesson2Quiz = [
  // Functions Questions (7 questions)
  {
    question: "What's the difference between positional and keyword arguments?",
    options: [
      "Positional must be in order; keyword can be in any order",
      "They're exactly the same",
      "Keyword arguments are faster",
      "Positional arguments can only be numbers"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: "Positional arguments must match the parameter order, but keyword arguments like greet(name='Alex', age=12) can be in any order!"
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if you call a function with a default parameter without providing that argument?",
    options: [
      "It causes an error",
      "It uses the default value",
      "It uses 0 or empty string",
      "The parameter is skipped"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Default parameters provide a fallback value. For example, def greet(name='Friend') allows calling greet() without arguments."
  },
  {
    question: "What does this function return: def get_stats(nums): return min(nums), max(nums)?",
    options: [
      "Just the minimum value",
      "Just the maximum value",
      "A tuple with both minimum and maximum",
      "An error"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "Functions can return multiple values as a tuple. You can unpack it like: smallest, largest = get_stats([1,5,3])"
  },
  {
    question: "What is a lambda function best used for?",
    options: [
      "Complex multi-line functions",
      "Simple one-line operations",
      "Functions that don't return anything",
      "Only mathematical calculations"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Lambda functions are perfect for simple operations like: double = lambda x: x * 2. For complex logic, use regular functions!"
  },
  {
    question: "What's the issue with this code? score = 100; def add(): score = score + 10",
    options: [
      "Nothing, it works fine",
      "Can't modify global variable directly inside function",
      "Score should be a string",
      "The function name is wrong"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "You can't modify a global variable like this. Instead, pass it as a parameter and return the new value!"
  },
  {
    question: "What does this lambda do: lambda student: student[1]?",
    options: [
      "Returns the second element of student",
      "Returns the first element of student",
      "Doubles the student value",
      "Creates an error"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: "student[1] accesses index 1 (the second element). Often used for sorting tuples like students.sort(key=lambda s: s[1])"
  },
  {
    question: "Which is a valid function with default parameters?",
    options: [
      "def greet(name='Sam', age): ...",
      "def greet(age, name='Sam'): ...",
      "def greet(name, age='10'): ...",
      "Both B and C are valid"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: "Default parameters must come AFTER non-default ones. So greet(age, name='Sam') and greet(name, age='10') both work!"
  },
  // Strings & Lists Questions (7 questions)
  {
    question: "What does 'Hello World'.strip() return?",
    options: [
      "'Hello World' (no change if no leading/trailing spaces)",
      "'HelloWorld' (removes all spaces)",
      "'HELLO WORLD'",
      "An error"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: "strip() only removes spaces from the beginning and end, not the middle. '  Hi  '.strip() becomes 'Hi'."
  },
  {
    question: "What does this f-string produce: f'{19.5:.2f}'?",
    options: [
      "'19.5'",
      "'19.50'",
      "'20'",
      "'19'"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: ":.2f formats a number to 2 decimal places. Perfect for displaying prices like $19.50!"

      "[1,2,3,4]",
      "[2,3,4]",
      "[1,2,3]",
      "[2,3,4,5]"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Slicing [1:4] means from index 1 up to (but not including) index 4. So [1,2,3,4,5][1:4] gives [2,3,4]."
  },
  {
    question: "What does 'python'.upper() return?",
    options: [
      "'python'",
      "'Python'",
      "'PYTHON'",
      "'pYtHoN'"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "upper() converts the entire string to uppercase letters. lower() does the opposite!"

    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,

  },
  {
    question: "What does [1,2,3,4,5][::-1] produce?",

      "[1,2,3,4,5]",
      "[5,4,3,2,1]",
      "[2,3,4]",
      "An error"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "[::-1] is a clever trick to reverse a list! The -1 step goes backwards through the entire list."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you split 'cat,dog,bird' into a list?",
    options: [
      "'cat,dog,bird'.split()",
      "'cat,dog,bird'.split(',')",
      "'cat,dog,bird'.divide(',')",
      "'cat,dog,bird'[',']"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "split(',') splits the string at each comma: ['cat', 'dog', 'bird']. split() with no argument splits on spaces!"
  },
  // File I/O Questions (6 questions)
  {
    question: "What does 'w' mode do when opening a file?",
    options: [
      "Writes to file, keeps existing content",
      "Writes to file, erases existing content",
      "Only reads the file",
      "Prevents any changes"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Be careful! 'w' mode erases everything in the file first. Use 'a' (append) mode to keep existing content!"
  },
  {
    question: "Why use 'with open()' instead of just 'open()'?",
    options: [
      "It's faster",
      "It automatically closes the file",
      "It creates better files",
      "It's required by Python"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "The 'with' statement automatically closes your file when done, even if errors occur. It's the safe way!"
  },
  {
    question: "What does file.read() return?",
    options: [
      "One line of the file",
      "The entire file content as a string",
      "A list of all lines",
      "Just the first word"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "read() grabs the ENTIRE file as one big string. Use readlines() to get a list, or loop through file for line-by-line reading."
  },
  {
    question: "What does 'a' mode do when opening a file?",
    options: [
      "Erases the file",
      "Adds content to the end of the file",
      "Only allows reading",
      "Creates an error"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "'a' (append) mode adds new content to the end without deleting what's already there. Perfect for logs or high scores!"
  },
  {
    question: "What exception should you catch when a file might not exist?",
    options: [
      "ValueError",
      "TypeError",
      "FileNotFoundError",
      "ReadError"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "FileNotFoundError is raised when you try to open a file that doesn't exist. Always use try/except when reading files!"

    question: "What's the correct way to write multiple lines to a file?",
    options: [
      "file.write(['line1', 'line2'])",
      "file.write('line1\\nline2\\n')",
      "file.writelines('line1', 'line2')",
      "file.append('line1', 'line2')"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "You need to include \\n (newline) characters yourself! write() doesn't add them automatically. Or use writelines() with a list."
  }
];

    question: "What makes Python different from languages like C#?",
    options: [
      "Python uses curly braces for code blocks",

      "Python requires semicolons at the end of lines",
      "Python needs type declarations for variables"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Python uses indentation (spaces) instead of curly braces {} to define code blocks. This makes Python code look cleaner and more readable!"

      "=",
      "==",
      "equals",
      "is same"

    options: [
      "function",
      "def",
      "func",
